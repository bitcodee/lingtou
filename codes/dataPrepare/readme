This folder is used to initialize the image data with new names to indicate the view of the image. Two parts are used to achieve the goal.

1. run washData.py to get the results saved in data/washed.
2. run personSplit.py to generate the data separated by tjid. e.g. each subfolder in the data/idFile folder contains the images from the same subject with different years.
3. The data in the data/idFile can be finally used for sequence prediction.
